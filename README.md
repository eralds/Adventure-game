# Start
Use the AdventureTextUi file to start the program. 
Also the game plays sounds so you should have them open for the full experience

Use the commands "list" or "help" if you get stuck in the game
There is also the walkthough that showcases how to win the game

Enjoy :)

# Walkthrough
After starting the game and putting your name you are located in the entrance.
Use the command "talk" 4 times to talk with the old man there.
He gives new tips (4 in total) each time you talk to him
You can get all the tips by using the command help but after the fourth time you talk to the old man he gives you a health potion

Then go to Room1 or Room2 and use the command attack to start battle
Make sure you focus your attacks on the weaker enemy first 
Also alternate between attacking and defending so you recieve less damage

To make sure you win the game firstly attack all the rooms with Zombies in them
Then go to the shop and buy the best armor and weapon you can get
Don't forget to always have at least one health potion with you 

Then attack the vampire to get a key you will use to open the door of the demon room
After that, attack the goblins and then the Demon.
It is recomended you have at least 2-3 healing potions with you when you attack the Demon

(Extra tip. If you cannot defeat the Demon you can buy a secret weapon in the store
By using "buy -1" you can buy Excalibur which costs 0 and has  100 attack.
This is meant as an easter egg of the game)
